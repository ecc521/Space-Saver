Space Saver can save you tens of gigabytes of disk usage without deleting ANYTHING.

NOTE: You can't see the effects of compression on applications from Finder. Instead, click on the Apple logo in the top left corner, go under "About this Mac", Click on Storage, and click "Manage"

Current issues:
macOS: There is not yet a way to prevent HFS+/APFS compression from happening, or to undo it, through the GUI
macOS: HFS+/APFS compression will be re-done every time you run the application on a specific file
