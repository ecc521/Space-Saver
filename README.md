Current releases are alpha - they may not work, be buggy, or be lacking features. This simply means that the application may fail to do anything - it does NOT mean that it is unsafe to run Space Saver on your files.


Space Saver can save you tens of gigabytes of disk usage without deleting ANYTHING.

NOTE: You can't see the effects of compression on applications from Finder. Instead, click on the Apple logo in the top left corner, go under "About this Mac", Click on Storage, and click "Manage"
