Releases are currently in beta (except for Linux RPM's - those aren't tested) 

Space Saver can save you tens of gigabytes of disk usage without deleting ANYTHING.

NOTE: You can't see the effects of compression on applications from Finder. Instead, click on the Apple logo in the top left corner, go under "About this Mac", Click on Storage, and click "Manage"

You can currently view the source code by opening the .asar archive.
A license is not currently available, though I plan on releasing the source repository under a open source license once Space Saver gets out of extremely rapid development
